# ReactCourseCode
code from assignments and following along to React - The Complete Guide course

# Assignments 
Assignments are in the assignments folder\
There's 2 versions of each assignment (both a class+function version and a function only version)\

# Main course code
The class + function version is in class-version and the function only version is in function-version\
There are small differences between the class + function version and function only version because there were things in the lecture (like component life cycle) that are only specific to classes and not functions or vice versa\
